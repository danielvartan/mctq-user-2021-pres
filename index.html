# {mctq}: <br> An R Package for the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire
### Daniel Vartanian
### July 2021

---









## Overview

.pull-left[
`mctq` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit to process the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), a quantitative and validated tool to assess chronotypes using peoplesâ€™ sleep behavior presented by Till Roenneberg, Anna Wirz-Justice, and Martha Merrow in [2003](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730402239679).

The aim of `mctq` is to facilitate the work of sleep and chronobiology scientists with MCTQ data while also helping with research reproducibility.

# The problem(s)

???

01:31 -&gt; 02:30

---

## Main challenges

* MCTQ requires a lot of date/time manipulation
* MCTQ deals with temporal objects detached from a timeline
* Lack of consistency in computations
* Inconsistencies can lead to irreproducible results

---

## Temporal objects

.pull-left[
Temporal objects comes with more levels of abstraction.

* Time is not metrical
* Time data can assume many formats
* Time is cyclical
* Time is relational (itself does not exist)

* Duodecimal (base 12) and sexagesimal (base 60) systems.
* Time frames (e.g., 24, 12, 60)

# The {mctq} package

???

02:31 -&gt; 04:30

---

## Installation


```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("gipsousp/mctq")
```


```r
library(mctq)
```


---

## Conversion

`mctq` works with a set of object classes specially created to hold time values. These classes can be found in the [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) and [hms](https://hms.tidyverse.org/) packages from [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). If your data do not conform to the object classes required, you can use `mctq` `convert()` function to convert it.


```r
# From decimal hours to `hms`
convert(6.5, "hms", input_unit = "H")
```

```
## 06:30:00
```

```r
# From radians to `Duration`
convert(1.308997, "Duration", input_unit = "rad")
```

```
## [1] "18000s (~5 hours)"
```

```r
# From `character` `HM AM/PM ` to `hms`
convert("10:00 PM", "hms", orders = "IMp")
```

```
## 22:00:00
```

---

## Workdays and work-free days variables

After your data is set to start, just use the `mctq` functions below to process it.

Note that the `mctq` functions uses a similar naming scheme to that used in the MCTQ publications. That makes it easy to find and apply any computation necessary.

* `fd()`: compute MCTQ work-free days
* `so()`: compute MCTQ local time of sleep onset
* `gu()`: compute MCTQ local time of getting out of bed
* `sd()`: compute MCTQ sleep duration
* `tbt()`: compute MCTQ total time in bed
* `ms()`: compute MCTQ local time of mid-sleep
* `napd()`: compute MCTQ nap duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sd24()`: compute MCTQ 24 hours sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)

---

## Workdays and work-free days variables

Example:


```r
# Local time of preparing to sleep on workdays
sprep_w &lt;- c(hms::parse_hms("23:45:00"), hms::parse_hms("02:15:00"))
# Sleep latency or time to fall asleep after preparing to sleep on workdays
slat_w &lt;- c(lubridate::dminutes(30), lubridate::dminutes(90))
# Local time of sleep onset on workdays
so(sprep_w, slat_w)
```

```
## 00:15:00
## 03:45:00
```

---

## Combining workdays and work-free days variables

For computations combining workdays and work-free days, use:

* `sd_week()`: compute MCTQ average weekly sleep duration
* `sd_overall()`: compute MCTQ overall sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sloss_week()`: compute MCTQ weekly sleep loss
* `le_week()`: compute MCTQ average weekly light exposure
* `msf_sc()`: compute MCTQ chronotype or corrected local time of mid-sleep on work-free days
* `sjl_rel()` and `sjl()`: compute MCTQ social jet lag
* `sjl_weighted()`: compute MCTQ absolute social jetlag across all shifts (only for MCTQ Shift)

---

## Combining workdays and work-free days variables

Example:


```r
# Local time of mid-sleep on workdays
msw &lt;- c(hms::parse_hms("02:05:00"), hms::parse_hms("04:05:00"))
# Local time of mid-sleep on work-free days
msf &lt;- c(hms::parse_hms("23:05:00"), hms::parse_hms("08:30:00"))
# Relative social jetlag
sjl_rel(msw, msf)
```

```
## [1] "-10800s (~-3 hours)"  "15900s (~4.42 hours)"
```

---

## Utilities

In addition to `convert()`, `mctq` is also equipped with many other utility functions.


```r
random_mctq(model = "standard") %&gt;% head(5)
```

```
## $work
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $wd
## [1] 5
## 
## $bt_w
## 22:55:00
## 
## $sprep_w
## 22:55:00
## 
## $slat_w
## [1] "600s (~10 minutes)"
```

---

## Data

The package also provides __fictional__ datasets of the standard, micro, and shift MCTQ versions __for testing and learning purposes__.
