## Overview

.pull-left[
`mctq` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit to process the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), a quantitative and validated tool to assess chronotypes using peoplesâ€™ sleep behavior presented by Till Roenneberg, Anna Wirz-Justice, and Martha Merrow in [2003](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730402239679).

The aim of `mctq` is to facilitate the work of sleep and chronobiology scientists with MCTQ data while also helping with research reproducibility.

## Main challenges

* MCTQ requires a lot of date/time manipulation
* Lack of consistency in computations
* Inconsistencies can lead to irreproducible results

# The {mctq} package

---

## Workdays and work-free days variables

* `fd()`: compute MCTQ work-free days
* `so()`: compute MCTQ local time of sleep onset
* `gu()`: compute MCTQ local time of getting out of bed
* `sd()`: compute MCTQ sleep duration
* `tbt()`: compute MCTQ total time in bed
* `ms()`: compute MCTQ local time of mid-sleep
* `napd()`: compute MCTQ nap duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sd24()`: compute MCTQ 24 hours sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)

---

## Combining workdays and work-free days variables

* `sd_week()`: compute MCTQ average weekly sleep duration
* `sd_overall()`: compute MCTQ overall sleep duration (only for MCTQ Shift)
* `sloss_week()`: compute MCTQ weekly sleep loss
* `le_week()`: compute MCTQ average weekly light exposure
* `msf_sc()`: compute MCTQ chronotype or corrected local time of mid-sleep on work-free days
* `sjl_rel()` and `sjl()`: compute MCTQ social jet lag
* `sjl_weighted()`: compute MCTQ absolute social jetlag across all shifts (only for MCTQ Shift)

---

## Combining workdays and work-free days variables

Example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Local time of mid-sleep on workdays
msw <- c(hms::parse_hm("02:05"), hms::parse_hm("04:05"))
# Local time of mid-sleep on work-free days
msf <- c(hms::parse_hm("23:05"), hms::parse_hm("08:30"))
# Relative social jetlag
sjl_rel(msw, msf)
```

# Final remarks

## Notes

* `mctq` is currently under a [rOpenSci software peer review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/434). We plan to submit it to CRAN soon after the review process ends.
* We plan to invite the MCTQ authors to review and author the package
* An article about `mctq` will be published soon
